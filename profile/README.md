# ðŸŽ­ Team Goofy
Welcome to the Team Goofy organization! We are a group of four Software Engineering students from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. This organization serves as a place for us to share some cool projects that we have worked on throughout our studies.

## ðŸš€ Current project
Our first project was the train game, a web app that lets users discover new places in the Netherlands by travelling by train. We are currently working on a mobile version of the train game. This will allow you to easily access the game on your smartphone and take it with you wherever you go. The mobile app will have all the features of the web app, plus some new ones that we are currently developing.
